	"content": "How I have missed your sight, feline,\nDying on the side of the street, lying in the pines;\nYour cute little eyes popped out of their holes,\nHanging from pink strands stickily attached to the inside of your skull.\n\nYears ago I would see you on my way home,\nSticking with your flesh soldered to the road;\nHow I smelled your sour stench of thick iron\nAnd gazed at the tracks upon your back the tires burned.\n\nI have not seen you, dead cat corpse, for years;\nI guess youâ€™ve since been pried off and joined with your crushed peers.\nOh, how my late afternoons have been sad with you gone;\nSo to you, bloody, run-over cat corpse, I dedicate this song.\n<p align=\"right\">Originally Written: May 11, 2013</p>",
