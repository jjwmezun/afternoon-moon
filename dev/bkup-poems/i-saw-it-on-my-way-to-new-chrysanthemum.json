	"content": "It all started when I left my hive at 2:00 PM,\nAs I ventured through the weeds, grains, and stems;\nBounced around the bulbous mushroom caps of various colors;\nAnd rode along the pollen flying in the zephyr.\n\nMy destination was the patches of New Chrysanthemum,\nWhere I would carry out my shift as Executive Manager of Pollination;\nBut I never made it that far,\nBecause I what I saw whilst climbing the maple bark.\n\nThere I saw in the crest between two thin branches,\nPartway covered by reddening leaves with serrated edges,\n‘Twas an object so bizarre, so inhuman, so absurd\nThat I could not even describe it with words—\nWhich is why I chose a medium comprised purely of words to tell this tale, of course.\nAlso, it was a photograph of a horse.\n\nWell, I decided this was far too much obscenity for my stable mind;\nSo I climbed right back up the vine to the brines in the skies;\nAnd as I drifted back home on my white pollen leaf,\nI tried to calm my thoughts by massaging my three beaks.\n“Such an evil the gods have wrought upon us all,” I did say;\nIt tired my brain so that I had to rest the rest o’ the day.\n\nAnd that, boss, was why I couldn’t come in to work yesterday;\nSuch a pity, I must say.\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Originally Written: May 4, 2013.</p>",
