But thanks to me, now I can't eat; \t&amp; when I can't eat,  I get hungry. But you don't see complaints from me;\nI took my tasty medicine, yes sire!\nI can take the dose. I must take the dose. \tIf I can't take the dose,  I must be beat. I can't take the dose. What am I to do?\nMy stomach, it scratches for sustenance... &amp; all I taste is gum blood. Gum blood doesn't taste too tangy. I break out into the street, Where I meet \tthe man with the sweep.\nI swallow myself whole. &amp; he-- \tthe polite fellow--  he sweeps 'way the debris. I told you I'd take my medicine.\n&amp; I did. 'Cause I deserved it.</pre>",
