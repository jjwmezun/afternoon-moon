    "content": "I don&rsquo;t know how, but some suns ago I ran into <a href=\"http://www.geocities.jp/scaffale00410/itoseilist.htm\">this page full o&rsquo; haiku</a> & made the mad mistake to try understanding it through Google Translate. The poetry I received touched me in places so touchy that I had to share them.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 電信柱（なだらかな緑の山を）  <b>Google Translate:</b> Telephone pole (a gentle green mountain)  A succinct contrast &rsquo;tween humble, e&rsquo;erlasting nature & the lightning-striking shadow cast by the modern technology brought on by this telephone pole stabbing into the earth like an upside-down sword.  Actually, I have a feeling this isn&rsquo;t e&rsquo;en that off o&rsquo; a translation.  It gets weirder.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 少年の死んだ日  <b>Google Translate:</b> Boy dead day  My favorite holiday.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 夕方（姉は小さな妹をすかし）  <b>Google Translate:</b> Evening (My sister watermark a little sister)  That&rsquo;s what happens when li&rsquo;l sis uses the 30-day free trial o&rsquo; big sis&rsquo;s eyeliner.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 夕方（子供が　泣かずに）  <b>Google Translate:</b> Evening (to not cry children)  A truly Issaesche haiku wherein the perspective is reversed, with the wolves warning o&rsquo; the dangers o&rsquo; the world&rsquo;s true monsters: undisciplined children running @ them & possible tugging @ their tails or ears.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 春（この冷たい目をした）  <b>Google Translate:</b> Spring (was this cold eye)  Stop watching me in April showers, Spring.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 餅をつく  <b>Google Translate:</b> Tell a rice cake  I told e&rsquo;m.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 私は甲虫  <b>Google Translate:</b> I beetle  The cruelly tantalizing title for a Kafka-Asimov crosso&rsquo;er that&rsquo;d ne&rsquo;er happen. The world is a worse place.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> （ある少女に）  <b>Google Translate:</b> (Keep yourself silent)  Must be the polite way to tell someone to shut their trap.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 生ひ立ち II  <b>Google Translate:</b> Freshness II  Not as good as the original.   <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 雨（雨とくさ　くさ）  <b>Google Translate:</b> Rain (rain cloudsiness)  Well, I know this translation can&rsquo;t be correct, &rsquo;cause \"cloudsiness\" isn&rsquo;t e&rsquo;en a real word.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> （何といふ）  <b>Google Translate:</b> (What is it?)  \"Epic\" by Faith No More.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> （提燈が一つ）  <b>Google Translate:</b> (One lantern is one)  \"Ayn Rand writes haiku.\"  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 赤子に  <b>Google Translate:</b> In a baby  Eww.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 切り通し  <b>Google Translate:</b> cutting  Emo haiku.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> （茶ぶだうが）  <b>Google Translate:</b> (Stupid)  I told you to translate, not editorialize, stupid machine.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> II　胃病患者（兎　兎　健康な兎）  <b>Google Translate:</b> II Stomach disease patient (rabbit healthy rabbit)  This one&rsquo;s apparently \"incomplete,\" as opposed to such complete works as \"woman\" & \"face.\" I guess we&rsquo;ll ne&rsquo;er know if the patient o&rsquo;ercomes his pain & eats the health-supplying rabbit&rsquo;s supple meat or not.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 骨牌の占ひ  <b>Google Translate:</b> Occupation of bone tiles  The noble, but forgotten craft.  I think this is the title o&rsquo; some \"Angry-Men\" British play.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 縫物をする人へ  <b>Google Translate:</b> To those who do sewing  We sew-lute you.  <hr />  <b>Scaffale:</b> 言葉（彼女は私の中に）  <b>Google Translate:</b> Language (she is in me)  English As She Is Spoke 2.0.  Strangely, most o&rsquo; the haiku seem to just be random words like \"woman,\" \"horse,\" \"face,\" \"night,\" & \"November.\" & many o&rsquo; these e&rsquo;en I can confirm are those words&mdash;&rsquo;less there&rsquo;s some subtle extra meaning in those words that I don&rsquo;t know.",
