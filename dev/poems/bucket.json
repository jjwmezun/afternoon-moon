Must hurry.\nDon't I know my worries will wane  if I only stop wasting my time in worry?\n&amp; here I worry mo' time worrying 'bout my worrying.\nI have no one to blame but myself. I know I should probably ask for help.\nNo!\nI most certainly should not ask for help.\nI shouldn't stuff my face with your pie while giving nigh.\nNo!\nI most certainly should stuff my face with your pie.\nHow uncouth would be such a denial?\nWe all want to take our vital vials;  but sometimes prescriptions cause contradictions,   &amp; the lord that is logic itself stipulates    that some must be deprived. So I'll dump that bucket 'gain &amp; 'gain,  Relishing its empty moments.\nThough I see the wall straight 'head,  I know my smash will be sudden. Fuck it.</pre>",
