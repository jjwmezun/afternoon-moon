	"content": "Nature, how your magnificence shall never cease;\nUnlike some other woman on which I could speak.\nGaze at how the tall golden grass dances in the breeze,\nHow the finches flap their wings and chirp with their beaks,\nHow they don’t leave me for that dick John Smothers and his fancy-ass law firm.\n\nThe sun’s rays warm me like a summer blanket;\nWhich replace the warmth loss from that bitch who gave me the cold shoulder over one little mistake.\nAs if she were just perfect, the snot!\nSo I shall lie here all afternoon under the sun\nAnd all night under the stars\nYOU HEAR THAT, MELISSA? I DON’T NEED YOU! GOOD RIDDANCE, I SAY!\nI’m perfectly fine here with nature! Couldn’t be happier!\nIt’s fucking magnificent!\n<p align=\"right\">Originally Written: March 13, 2013</p>",
