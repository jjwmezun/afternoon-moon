    "content": "My rest is ravaged by nightmares, thanks to the guilt\nOf the terrible deed that still makes my heart wilt.\nThough I fear this may reveal me, I cannot keep this secret alone;\nFor if else, I shall be driven mad down to the bone.\nSo, if you please, listen to this story\nOf how I made an innocent man deceased. His life was placed utterly within my own hands;\nTo make him run and jump across these bright brown lands.\nThe feeling! It filled me with such an addictive buzz!\nTo hear the crispy electric trill whenever he jumped!\nI made him bump against bricks and blocks with question-mark ticks;\nI made him eat bulbous red mushrooms that made him grow big. But soon I would learn the need to use my power responsibly,\nWhen I saw a chestnut-shaped beast step toward my devotee.\nI tried to leap away, but I could only go so far back;\nAnd my nerves were so shot that I inevitably cracked!\nI wailed as I saw the goblin bump against my friend,\nBut sighed in relief when I saw he had only shrunk again.\nSadly, though, this is not where the tale is finished;\nFor when I ran him into another monster, he was tossed off into the abyss. At first, I was in tears at such a tragic death,\nUntil I learned my friend still had four more tries left!\nI was pumped with such joy as I saw him return to the screen!\nThis time, I would not betray my devotee!\nI snatched up the mushroom and grew so huge,\nAnd battered the vile monsters till they were black and blue;\nBut as I made him leap from pipe to pipe with such excitement,\nI slipped up a jump and made him fall into an endless abyss. Again and again, I led my friend to harm,\nAs I watched his life counter decrease with alarm;\nUntil on his last try, success was yet again spurned,\nAnd the screen was covered in blackness with bone-white words saying, “GAME OVER.”\nThat was when I dropped my controller at prompt,\nAnd rushed to that blasted machine and shut it off.\nNever again would I touch such devilish magic;\nTo think of what other troubles could happen! So I sit here years later, trying to forget the tragedy,\nAnd hope that someday society will be able to forgive me;\nI try to salvage the one lesson I gained from committing this sin:\nThat life is not just a little game we should play with.\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Originally Written: March 13, April 4, 2013.</p>",
