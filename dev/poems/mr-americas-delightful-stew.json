I show no fear,\nI feign ignorance;\nbut I know what you're boiling up...\nTricky li'l devil, you... I know what you're planning:\nyou won't just smash me with your invisible palm;\nyou'll do it nice &amp; slow...\nNice &amp; slow...\nLike a fine stew.\nDelicious. Can you taste the spiciness o' my blood,\nthe tanginess o' my gizzards?\nNo...\nNo, you wouldn't, would you...\nYou wouldn't taste nothing at all,\nwouldn't even notice my stew 'pon your plate.\nThat's the trouble with you:\nyou're always so busy;\nYou never have time to enjoy the screams o' your prey.\nNow, what kind o' life is that?\nGet out mo', Mr. America;\nbreathe some fresh air.\nI like to do that oft,\nwhen it won't get me in trouble.\nThere are lots o' things that will get me in trouble.\nSince you're so free,\nyou never tell me what they are.\nSo I have to guess.\nSometimes I guess wrong.\nBut that's OK.\nI like the mental stimulation. But you, Mr. America:\nyou're 'bove getting in trouble.\nSo, why aren't you happier? I know you won't read this.\nSo many wives &amp; not 'nough time to listen to them.\n'Sides, you wouldn't like what they have to say.\nThat's OK.\nI'd like to say that you'll regret me when I'm gone;\nbut that would not be perfectly accurate.\nSo, please, don't finish that stew I made for you if you don't want it.\nI did a bad job, anyway.\nI'm always doing a bad job.\nI even tried ripping a few pieces o' my flesh\n&amp; adding them as you like.\nBut I guess it wasn't...\nNo.\nNo, there's no use in laboring the issue.\nJust shove it to the side.\nSomeone will pick it up eventually.\n&amp; if not, the flies will surely enjoy it.\n</pre>",
