The risks!\nThrow down the dice &amp; how you don't get snake eyes... \tYou'll shrivel and die... You'll do fine...\nIf you truly want to live, You'll do everything right.\nThe hand knows everything... It knows if you've been bad or good,\nKnows whether you have or have not been efficient.\nWould it harm you if you didn't deserve it? How would we know if you didn't?\nThe hand knows.\nIt knows you.\nYou don't know it.\nYou can't even see it.\nYou're nothing to it. So shut up,\nCalm down,\nButton-up that jacket, chap,\n&amp; go to town.\nEverything'll work out swell. Everything's safe here. Just. Don't. Fuck it up.\n</pre>",
