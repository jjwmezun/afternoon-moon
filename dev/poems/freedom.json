    "content": "Steal Joe was a freedom-loving American,\nSo he did what he had to do:\nHe overthrew the tyrannical government,\nSo his economic chains could finally be eschewed. Now he could do with his property what he desired;\nNobody would boss him around.\nHe charged whatever rent he concocted;\nNo regulations to keep him down.\nAfter all, it was his property;\nHe had the right to control it all by himself.\nIf any of those socialist sponges had a problem\nThey could go away somewhere else.\nIf those violent thugs caused trouble,\nWhy, he’d have to teach them with his own might;\nSo he hired his own personal military\nTo ensure nobody violated his ownership rights.\nAnd since this property was his,\nHe had the right to devise all of its rules;\nSo if those grumbling commies had the nerve to criticize him\nHe’d throw out all of those fools.\nAnd if nobody else would take them—\nFor they had the rights to reject them, as well—\nWhy, Steal Joe would have no choice\nBut to lock them up in jail. Steal Joe toasted himself to his newly-created libertarian dream:\nFinally, he created an economy renowned for its efficiency.\nNow, all he needed was a name for this new vision:\nAnd so, to reward himself for his good deeds, he dubbed it Stealinism.\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">Originally Written: February 21-May 30, 2013.</p>",
