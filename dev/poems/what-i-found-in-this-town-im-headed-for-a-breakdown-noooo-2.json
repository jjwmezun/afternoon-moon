I won't let you!\n...\n[It slips out the fire 'scape.]\nThough in my eye 'twas all the time,\nit 'scaped my sight till th'apex of its flight. Where did the warm orange tea go?\nRan out the door hours ago;\n&amp; it didn't even take its aftertaste. Remember the times inside rainy days?\nWhen we'd save Toad from dumped paint?\nYou were there--you'd know. I remember all the warm dank caves.\nYou didn't like them, but I did just the same.\n(&amp; this is 'bout me, anyway\n--make your own shame.)\nWhen they seem lost, I get a glimpse o' their glow;\nbut this time it seems as if they're truly gone. Today I saw burnt-black mushrooms on the lawn.\nMaybe they'll be fed by rain.\nBut I'm sure it'll leave them just the same:\nslid out the 'scape in just the same way. That's how they get you, it seems:\nfeed you up on that bitchin' graham cracker cuisine,\ntill it digs a li'l hole where it always lives,\n&amp; then they try to fill it with that lobster shit.\nNot me.  I don't know where it's been.   I'm not ready.    I've just started. Please may we have peace?\nThat blasted sweet melody!\nDo do... do, do-do-do...       Fuck, I can't even get it right.           It won't last the night, you know.                Nothing will.\nDon't think your childish inanities are too good to go.                'Sides, now we have a heavy beat.\nBum, dum dum dum-dum...\nI can't that right, either.\nSay, this reminds me o' that time I was ill.\nIsn't the way we look back @ such seeming tragedies kinda neat?      Yeah, me neither. &amp; you know what's sick?\nI'm sure I'll look back @ this with a slick grin.\nWell, no, I s'pose I've exaggerated;\nI'll look back in an autumn o' content.\nHow we cheer @ the leaves regrown,\nignoring their predecessors thrown.\nFor though I know I look stupid bending my own stem,  Know some o' us aren't smart 'nough to stop.\n&amp; 'sides, a'least I get to hear those groovy tunes in the interim.  Da da da da da-da da...</pre>",
